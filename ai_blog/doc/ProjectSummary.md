# AI Blog Project Summary

*Generated on: 2025-04-21*

## Project Overview

This project is a Django-based blog application named "AI Blog". It provides a platform for creating, sharing, and managing blog posts, along with user interaction features. It utilizes the Django framework, SQLite for the database (in development), and includes separate Django apps for core blog functionality (`blog`) and user accounts (`accounts`).

## Implemented Features

Based on the documentation and project structure, the following features are currently implemented:

*   **Post Management:**
    *   Create, Edit, Delete Posts (Author-specific)
    *   Rich Text Editing (CKEditor)
    *   Post Listing (Paginated) & Detail Views
    *   Draft & Publish Statuses
    *   Post Visibility (Public/Private)
    *   View Count Tracking
*   **User Authentication & Profiles:**
    *   User Registration, Login, Logout
    *   User Profiles (Displaying info, user's posts, comments)
    *   Profile Editing (Including profile picture uploads to `media/profile_pics/`)
*   **Organization:**
    *   Categories (Assigning posts, listing posts by category)
    *   Tags (Assigning posts, listing posts by tag)
    *   Series (Grouping posts, following series)
*   **Engagement & Interaction:**
    *   Comments on Posts (Adding, Displaying)
    *   Comment Likes
    *   Post Likes
    *   Post Bookmarking (Saving posts, adding notes)

*   **Notifications:**
    *   Notifications for new posts (general and series-specific)
    *   User Notification Preferences
*   **Other:**
    *   Newsletter Signup
    *   Ad Spaces Functionality
    *   RSS Feed (`/feed/`)
    *   Page Visit Tracking

## To-Be-Implemented Features (According to Docs)

The existing documentation explicitly lists these features as planned but not yet implemented:

*   **User Roles and Permissions:** Differentiated roles (admin, author, reader) with specific permissions.
*   **Advanced Search Enhancements:** More filtering options (e.g., date, author).
*   **Social Sharing Integration:** Direct sharing to social media platforms.
*   **Improved Comment Moderation:** Tools for flagging, approval queues, etc.
*   **Comprehensive Content Management System (CMS):** A more integrated backend for managing all content aspects beyond the basic Django admin.

## Areas for Improvement (According to Docs & Best Practices)

*   **Code Refactoring:** General improvements for readability and maintainability.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Database query optimization, caching (basic `LocMemCache` is configured, but could be more advanced like Redis/Memcached), static file handling for production.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** More user-friendly error messages.
*   **UI/UX Design:** General improvements to the user interface and experience.
*   **Testing:** Need for more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **Security:** Ongoing implementation of security best practices (some headers added, but needs review for production).
*   **Database:** Migrate from SQLite to a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   **Static & Media Files:** Configure production-ready serving (e.g., using WhiteNoise or a dedicated service like S3).
