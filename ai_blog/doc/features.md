# Implemented Features

This document provides a detailed description of the features currently implemented in the blog project.

## Post Management

The core functionality of the blog revolves around managing posts. This includes:

*   **Post Creation:** Authenticated users can create new blog posts. The post creation form allows users to specify the title, content, categories, tags, and other relevant information. The content is edited using a rich text editor (CKEditor).
*   **Post Editing:** Authors can edit their existing posts. The editing interface pre-populates the form with the current post data, allowing modifications to be made.
*   **Post Deletion:** Authors can delete their own posts. A confirmation step is usually included to prevent accidental deletions.
*   **Post Listing:** The main blog page displays a paginated list of published posts, typically ordered by creation or publication date. Each listing usually includes the post title, a short excerpt, author information, and publication date.
*   **Post Detail View:** Clicking on a post title or excerpt leads to the detailed view of that post. This view displays the full post content, author information, publication date, categories, tags, and a comment section.

## User Authentication and Profiles

The project includes features for user management:

*   **User Registration:** New users can create accounts by providing a username, email address, and password.
*   **User Login:** Registered users can log in to the application using their credentials.
*   **User Logout:** Logged-in users can log out of the application.
*   **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile page that displays information about them, such as their username, bio, and potentially other details. The profile may also list the user's posts or other relevant activity.
*   **Profile Editing:** Users can edit their profile information, such as their bio or profile picture.

## Categories and Tags

To organize and classify blog posts, the project utilizes categories and tags:

*   **Categories:** Posts can be assigned to one or more categories, representing broad topics or subject areas (e.g., "Technology," "Travel," "Food").
*   **Tags:** Posts can be associated with multiple tags, which are keywords or labels that provide more specific information about the post's content (e.g., "Python," "Hiking," "Recipes").
*   **Category and Tag Listings:** Users can view lists of posts belonging to a specific category or tag by clicking on the category or tag name associated with a post.

## Comments

To enable interaction and discussion, the project includes a comment system:

*   **Adding Comments:** Users (potentially authenticated users only) can add comments to blog posts. The comment form typically includes a text field for the comment content and may require the user's name or other identifying information.
*   **Displaying Comments:** Comments are displayed below the post content in the post detail view, usually ordered by creation date.

## Search Functionality

Users can search for posts based on keywords:

*   **Search Form:** A search bar or form is available, allowing users to enter search terms.
*   **Search Results:** Submitting the search form displays a list of posts that match the search query, typically based on the post title or content.

## Bookmarks and Likes

To allow users to save and show appreciation for posts:

*   **Bookmarks:** Users can bookmark posts to save them for later viewing. Bookmarked posts are typically accessible from the user's profile or a dedicated bookmarks page.
*   **Likes:** Users can like posts to indicate their approval or appreciation. The number of likes for each post may be displayed.

## Newsletter Signup

To keep users informed about new content:

*   **Signup Form:** A newsletter signup form is available, allowing users to subscribe by providing their email address.
*   **Subscription Management:** The system stores the email addresses of subscribers and may provide options for managing subscriptions (e.g., unsubscribing).

## Ad Spaces

To monetize the blog or promote content:

*   **Ad Space Definition:** The project allows for defining ad spaces in different locations on the page (e.g., sidebar, header, within content).
*   **Ad Display:** Active ad spaces are displayed in their designated locations, potentially showing different ads based on configuration or targeting criteria.
